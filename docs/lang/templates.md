Templates
=========

Template literals are strings with embedded expresisions. An `expression` enclosed by `${` and `}` is getting evaluated and replaced by the returned value.

Syntax

```
const tmpl = `Hello ${[expression]}`
```

#### FireScript

```fire
const greeting = `Hello ${name}`
```

#### Javascript

```js
const greeting = `Hello ${name}`;
```
