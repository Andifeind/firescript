Variables
=========

Firescript supports two variable types. `const` and `let`.

`const` and `let` are both block scoped variables. The value of a `const` can't be changed or re-declared.  

Syntax
------

```
const|let|var [name] = [value]
```

#### Firescript

```coffee
const foo = 'Foo'
let bar = 'Bar'
```

#### Javascript

```js
const foo = 'Foo';
let bar = 'Bar';
```
